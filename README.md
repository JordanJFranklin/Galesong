🌬️ Galesong

A windswept action-adventure game in development

📖 Overview

Galesong is a third-person action-adventure project that blends fast-paced combat, cinematic camera design, and deep RPG systems. Inspired by titles like Hollow Knight, Elden Ring, and The Pathless, the game emphasizes fluid movement, strategic ability usage, and immersive worldbuilding.

This repository showcases my work in gameplay programming, system design, and worldbuilding, demonstrating my ability to create complex mechanics, implement scalable architecture, and craft a polished player experience.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Engine: Unity (C#)

Languages: C#, SQL (for data management), Python (tools/scripts)

Systems:

Cinematic Camera Systems (lock-on, grapple, ability-based angles, dynamic zoom/FOV)

Ability Framework (wind magic, melee skills, status effects)

Card/Relic Equipment System (inspired by talismans, with unique tactical builds)

Custom Physics Systems (swinging mechanics, grapple pulling, spring joints)

Database-driven Stats & Effects (scalable and modifiable for balance testing)

🎮 Key Features
⚔️ Combat & Abilities

Wind-Enhanced Combat: A moveset centered on kicks, fans, and jet-propelled footwear (Allegrith).

Signature Abilities: Includes Tempest Kick, Whirling Wall, Rising Gale, and more. Each ability is coded with cinematic camera integration, scaling effects, and status interactions.

Status & Stat System: Extensive framework covering health, stamina (Scarlet), regen, cooldowns, critical mechanics, evasion, block power, etc.

📸 Cinematic Cameras

Ability-triggered cameras (e.g., Tempest Kick zooms, dynamic FOV, and screen shake).

Exploration camera inspired by The Pathless (rule-of-thirds framing, off-center follow, smooth strafe look-ahead).

Grapple & swing cameras (fixed cinematic angles, target-focused reeling).

Lock-on camera refinements (off-center look, dynamic zoom/FOV, obstacle handling).

🌀 World & Lore

Swallowtail Tribe: Nomadic sky people living on a flying manta ray.

Symphum Weapons: Legendary tools of wind magic (e.g., Allegrith).

Unique NPCs: From seamstresses and traders to fortune tellers and brewers, each tied into mechanics and story.

Forest Species – Numen: Small, glowing seed-creatures with different combat and support roles.

🃏 Tactical Cards

Collectible Tactic cards offering conditional effects, passive bonuses, and summon synergies.

Inspired by relic systems in roguelikes but adapted for a persistent RPG structure.

Designed to promote build diversity, trade-offs, and experimentation.
